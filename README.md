This is the report for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Projects. We got our data from AZ
Direct GMBH. The end goal is to help them identify new customers for a mail-order company based on
existing customer data and whole population of the Germany. The idea is to train an unsupervised
learning model to identify the similarity and difference between the general population and the mail-in
companyâ€™s customers based on geographical features provided. And then build a supervised learning
model to identify potential new customers with the training data.
For this project I used Principle Component Analysis for feature deduction, KMeans for clustering and
Xgboost for classification. I will talk about the details about Preprocessing and EDA, model selection and
training, hyperparameter tuning in the following part.
